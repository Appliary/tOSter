# The Pow2Led cable

This cable connects the battery to the end of the LEDs chain.

There is only two cable to connect : 5v and GND.

## Connectors

On the battery side, we have USB-A.

On the LEDs side, I used a JST-SM-4 female connector to match the existing male connector on the LEDs stripes.

## Schematics

| USB-A Pin    | Wire color | JST-SM-4 pin | LED stripe pin |
