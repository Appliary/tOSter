# Protogen

Protogen are fantasy species in the furry fandom.

As a joke, they are sometimes referred as toasters.

## Anatomy

Protogen are Anthro, cyborg-like creatures.

Protogen are approximately 40% artificial, with the large majority of their internal workings remaining biological in nature. Protogen have biological ears, and can have up to 3 sets on rare variants. Protogen's biological organs remain intact, and as such, are required to function for the health of the Protogen. However, Protogen do not have the capability for natural reproduction.

A Protogen's visor is crafted using a special 'nanite' (Nano-Computer) matter capable of changing shape and moving, allowing the Protogen to form a functional mouth and consume/eat food, as their digestive tract is functional. Each particle within the visor is an individual 'nanite', each of which are programmed to simulate a functional muscle and nervous system within the face. When required, food is broken down by the cluster of 'nanites', swallowed and digested naturally. Special optic nanites run through the visor, as well as illuminated nanites to display the Protogen's facial features.

The Protogen possess the ability to swap out large numbers of their limbs, as they are equipped to be modular. They are attached via Magnetic nanite sockets, and applicable limbs include tails, arms and legs.
